## Description 

I developed this app to efficiently track employee information, including their department, role, and manager. The project aimed to demonstrate my expertise in SQL queries, and database management. While working on this app, I encountered several challenges, making it one of the most time-consuming and challenging projects to make. One of the major issues I encountered was the difficulty in starting my server 'server.js'. After reaching out for help, my tutor pointed out that I had forgotten to source my SQL files, which was crucial for the app to run smoothly. This was a valuable lesson in managing dependencies and configurations correctly. Additionally, I faced several minor issues that required debugging. I learned to utilize 'console.log' effectively to identify problems in my code. Throughout this project, I gained a deeper understanding of control flow techniques, Axios, and SQL queries. 

## Usage

This app is designed for straightforward use. It serves as an employee tracking tool, allowing you to perform various operations, such as adding new employees, viewing existing records, and reassigning roles. To get started, follow these simple steps: Begin by launching the server using the 'node server.js' command. Next, navigate to the 'inquirer.js' directory in your terminal. Once in the 'inquirer.js' directory, run 'node inquirer.js'. This action triggers a series of questions, presenting you with a list of choices.
